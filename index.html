          <h2>WAYANG KULIT STORYBOARD</h2>
          <p> Once upon a time, in the mystical world of Javanese wayang kulit, there was a great warrior named Bima. Tall, strong, and fierce, Bima was one of the Pandava brothers, known for his unmatched bravery and strength. His hands, shaped like claws, symbolized his readiness for battle, while his bold black complexion reflected the depth of his courage. His very presence demanded respect, his booming voice echoing with the power of a thousand held storms.</p>
          <p>But the land of Hastinapura was no longer a place of peace. The wicked king, Duryodhana, had seized control, driving the Pandavas into exile. The whispers of injustice scattered like wildfire, fuming a flame of righteous fury in the hearts of the people.</p>
          <p>Bima, fueled by the injustice, vowed to reclaim his rightful place. He gathered his brothers, Arjuna, the skilled archer, Yudhishthira, the righteous leader, Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins known for their wit and strength. Together, they embarked on a journey to restore balance to the land. They sought the guidance of their wise uncle, Krishna, who became their trusted advisor and guider. Along their path, they tested their skills, and faced tough challenges, each challenge tested their strengths and abilities.</p>
          <p>Bima and his brothers—Arjuna, Yudhishthira, Nakula, and Sahadeva—set out to reclaim their kingdom from the wicked King Duryodhana. Along the way, they face challenges like bandits and magical creatures. Bima uses his strength, while Arjuna shows off his archery skills and Yudhishthira offers wise advice. They gather allies who share their goal.</p>
          <p>Duryodhana learns about their journey and seeks help from the warriors of Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and his uncle Shakuni to stop them. The brothers had already known that they must prepare for a big fight.</p>
          <p>The brothers reach Duryodhana’s stronghold, and Bima confronts Karna in a fierce battle. Just when Bima is about to defeat Karna, he chooses to show mercy and urges Karna to join them instead of fighting for Duryodhana. This act makes Karna reconsider his loyalty.</p>
          <p>Karna decides to join the Pandavas, and together they face Duryodhana and his forces. The people of Hastinapura, inspired by the brothers, rise up against Duryodhana’s absolute power. The battle is fierce, but the Pandavas, now united with Karna, push back Duryodhana's forces.</p>
          <p>Bima challenges Duryodhana to a duel and defeats him. With Duryodhana defeated, the Pandavas reclaim their thrones. They promise to rule with justice and compassion. As they look out over their kingdom, they celebrate their victory and the bond they share as brothers, knowing they’ve restored peace to Hastinapura.</p>

          <h1>QUARTER 4: TYPHOON KOPPU -- BAGYONG LANDO</h1>
          <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XxCB5trR/IMG-4094.jpg" alt="IMG-4094" border="0"></a>
    
            
        <h2> PART 1: Gathering Information !</h2>
          <h4> What is the basic information of the typhoon? (This includes the wind speed, the amount of precipitation it brought, when and where it occurred, etc.) </h4>

<p> Typhoon Lando, also known as Koppu, was a Super Typhoon that hit the Luzon region of the Philippines in mid-October of 2015. It was the 24th named storm and 15th typhoon of the year. The storm originated as a tropical disturbance near the Mariana Islands on October 10th. It moved west, intensifying into a tropical depression the following day and then a tropical storm on October 13th. Over the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, Lando quickly intensified/strengthened. On October 17th, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as a Category 4 Super Typhoon with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). Koppu/Lando made landfall near Casiguran, Philippines. It weakened after encountering the mountainous terrain of Luzon and moved over the South China Sea on October 19th. </p>
  

 <h4> What is the basic information of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon (This includes the geographical location, economic status, population, etc.)?</h4>

        <p> The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed Koppu to have been a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon with one minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). The storm subsequently made landfall at this strength near Casiguran, Philippines. Rapid weakening ensued the due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of Luzon and the disheveled core of Koppu emerged over the South China Sea on October 19. </p>
          
         <h4>How was the community affected by the typhoon?</h4> 

<p> The Typhoon Koppu affected a lot of families in Luzon, Powerful winds caused widespread damage and disruption across Luzon. Nine provinces suffered total power outages and throughout the affected regions of Luzon, But 9 million people, and 10 percent of the entire province had lost electricity.  UnfortunBefore Typhoon Koppu struck, the government issued early warnings, and families in high-risk areas evacuated. Emergency response teams were deployed, and people stocked up on food, water, and other necessities. Schools and public buildings served as evacuation centers, while authorities provided consonant storm updates. After the typhoon, relief efforts began immediately. The government and aid group provided food, water, and medical supplies. Temporary shelters housed displaced families, anately 1.24 million families were directly affected by the heavy storm/wind at that point, 113,584 people moved to evacuation centers.</p>
          

          <h4> How did the community prepare for it? How did they recover?</h4>
<p> Before Typhoon Koppu struck, the government issued early warnings, and families in high-risk areas are evacuated. Emergency response teams were deployed, and people stocked up on food, water, and other necessities. Schools and public buildings served as evacuation centers, while authorities provided constant storm updates. After the typhoon, relief efforts began immediately. The government and aid groups provided water, foods, and medical supplies. Temporary shelters housed displaced families, and power companies worked to restore electricity. Roads and buildings were repaired, and financial aid helped families rebuild it. Despite the challenges, communities came together to recover and support one another.</p>
          
          
<h4> How vulnerable are they to typhoons?</h4> 
                       <p> The severe flooding and displacement as a result of Typhoon Koppu raises the vulnerability of affected communities to disease outbreaks.” </p>
          

<h4>Were there any damages? How severe were they?</h4>
          <p> The Super Typhoon Lando caused lots of damage across the Luzon region of the Philippines. The damages resulted as the typhoon struck and destroyed about 277,060 hectares of rich agricultural lands in the Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon and Cordillera regions. These provinces lost about 5.3 billion pesos worth of palay because of the super typhoon. There's also recorded production loss of corn and other high value crops that's worth 613.4 million pesos.Its powerful winds caused widespread damage across Luzon Region and caused a blackout to 9 million people. About 1.24 million people  were directly affected by the storm, 113,584 people moved to evacuation centers. Throughout the affected regions, 17,254 houses were damaged and 1,504 were destroyed. 62 people were killed, and total damage reached ₱14.4 billion.</p>
  
          
          <h4>Was the typhoon accompanied by secondary disasters? How did they affect the community? </h4>
<p> The Typhoon Koppu/Lando struck the Philippines in October 2015, bringing massive flooding, landslides, and storm surges that greatly affected communities, especially in Luzon. The slow-moving typhoon caused extended heavy rainfalls, extensive flooding that submerged homes, roads and farmlands.</p>

  <p> In areas such as Benguet and Nueva Ecija, continuous rains triggered landslides, burying houses and blocking roads, which made rescue operations difficult Coastal communities also faced storm surges, which damaged properties and fishing boats. The strong winds also caused toppled trees, power lines, and buildings, causing widespread blackouts.</p>

         <p> As a result, thousands of families were displaced, forced to evacuate to temporary shelters. Many lost their homes, and sources of incomes, especially farmers, as rice fields and other crops were destroyed. The typhoon also resulted in numerous casualties, including brutal deaths and injuries, further straining rescue and relief efforts.</p>

         <h4>Were there any positive impacts of the typhoon in the region? What are those?</h4> 
<p> While Typhoon Lando/Koppu caused a lot of damage and hardship in the Philippines, it did have some positive impacts/benefits. The heavy rains helped to fill up major dams in Luzon, which provide water for many areas, including Metro Manila. The water levels in Angat, Pantabangan, Magat, San Roque, and Ambuklao dams all increased significantly. This means that there was more water available for drinking, irrigation, and other uses.</p>

          <h1> PART 3: Proposed Solution to Mitigate the Impact of Typhoons ! </h1>
          <p> ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS:
          Environmental awareness can reduce the impact of a typhoon by teaching people how to prepare for an incoming typhoon as well as the cause and effect of a typhoon like flood and landslides. Communities should practice proper garbage disposal, drainage maintenance and planting trees as it can serve as a natural barrier against strong winds and floods.
